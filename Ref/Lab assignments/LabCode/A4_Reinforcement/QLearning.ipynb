    "## **1. Reinforcement Learning, introduction**\n",
    "In the previous assignments we have explored supervised learning, in other words, methods that train a model based on known inputs and targets. This time, we will instead look at a branch of machine learning that is much closer to the intuitive notion of \"learning\". Reinforcement learning, or RL for short, does not work with inputs and targets, but instead learns by performing **actions** in an **environment** and observing the generated **rewards**.\n",
    "\n",
    "RL is a very broad concept and many different algorithms have been deviced based on these general concepts of actions and rewards. Perhaps the main advantage of RL over other machine learning techniques is that we do not explicitly tell the model what the right answer is (like we have done in the previous assignments), but instead only tell the model when the desired outcome has been acheived. This might seem like the same thing at first, but the key difference is that RL allows the model to device solutions that outperform the human teacher. This is usually not possible in traditional supervised learning since the model can only get as good as the training data (the teacher). With the freedom to explore new strategies, which is inherent to RL, this is no longer true and some truly astounding results have been acheved. The most famous example is probably AlphaGo, the first computer program to beat a human expert in the board game Go. [Here is an excellent documentary](https://youtu.be/WXuK6gekU1Y), if you have some time to spare. For those of you that want a quicker and more fun example, [here is a video about RL agents playing hide and seek](https://youtu.be/kopoLzvh5jY), which very clearly demonstrates the power of RL to invent new and hidden strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, these examples are from the very forefront of current research in RL, and are unfortunately too complex for this assignment. We will instead work on a much simpler problem, but the core concepts that you will implement and investigate here are the same that made the above possible."

    "You will now implement the main algorithm of this assignment, **Q-learning**. This algorithm is powerful since it allows the simultaneous exploration of different **policies**. This is done by a state-action table **Q**, keeping track of the expected reward associated with each action in each state. By iteratively updating these estimates as we get new rewards, the policies explored by the agent eventually converges to the optimal policy. This can all be summarized in the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\large Q\\left(s_t,a\\right) \\leftarrow \\underbrace{Q\\left(s_t,a\\right)}_{\\mathrm{Old \\space value}} \\cdot \\left(1-\\alpha\\right) + \\alpha \\cdot \\underbrace{\\left(r + \\gamma V\\left(s_{t+1}\\right)\\right)}_{\\mathrm{New \\space estimate}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This defines that the value of $Q$ in a state $s_t$ for action $a$, i.e $Q\\left(s_t,a\\right)$, should be updated as a weighted average of the old value and a new estimate, where the weighting is based on the learning rate $\\alpha \\in (0,1)$. The new estimate is a combination of the reward $r$ for the action we are updating, and the estimated value $V$ of the next state $s_{t+1}$, discounted by the factor $\\gamma \\in (0,1]$. By increasing $\\gamma$, the future value is weighted higher, which is why we say that this optimizes for long-term rewards."

    "You will now design a series of experiments to show the impact of the three main hyperparameters - learning rate, discount factor, and exploration rate - in different environments. You are free to extend the experiments as you see fit in order to make your point in the discussions, but a recommended strategy is to try two extreme cases (low vs high values). For each parameter, there is one world in particular of the four you have already used where it is easy to show the effects we are looking for. Figuring out which worlds is part of the excercise."

    "- World 5, Warpspace: As the name suggests, in this world there is one tile in which the agent enters warpspace and imediatly moves to another specific location. How do you think this will affect the learning?\n",
    "- World 6, Torus: In this world, the opposite edges are connected together like a rolled-up paper. If you connect both the up-down and left-right edges, you get a mathematical shape called a torus which has no edges. This means that the closest path to the goal might not be obvious anymore.\n",
    "- World 7, Steps: This world is a staircase of increasing rewards (although still all negative). However, moving up the stairs towards higher rewards also puts the agent further from the goal. So what is the optimal choice, to go for the long path with higher rewards, or to sprint throught the low rewards towards the goal. This depends on the value of gamma."

    "So far, every world has been a 2D-grid (y and x dimensions), and the four actions have been the same in every world. It has therefore been possible to write the code with this in mind, probably resulting in code where you index Q for example with `Q[s[0], s[1], a]` for a given state `s` and action `a`. However, it is possible to slightly rewrite the code to be independent of the number of dimensions in the state space, which means that we can then explore much more interesting worlds. It is also a nice excercise in how to write code that is general and modular. The way to do this is to index Q in the following way: `Q[(*s,a)]`. It's perfectly fine if you want to consider this as \"python magic\", but for the interested here is an explaination.\n",
    "\n",
    "The state `s` is a tuple, for example `(3,6)`. A quirk in python is that tuples can be used to index into arrays, with each value in the tuple indexing separate dimensions in the array. For example, if Q is a 10x15x4 array, then `Q[(3,6)]` will return the vector of four values in Q that are in the 3rd row and 6th column (i.e. all the action values for state `s = (3,6)`). The problem is that we want to access the Q-value of a specific action when updating with a new reward. One might assume that `Q[s,a]` would work, but this now works differently since we explicitly index Q with not only a tuple. The solution is to remake a tuple that contains both `s` and `a`, and then index Q with this. We can do this by first unpacking the state tuple by calling `*s`, then creating a new tuple with `(*s,a)`, containing both the state and action. For example, if `s = (3,6)` and `a = 2`, then `(*s,a) = (3,6,2)`. We then use this tuple to index into Q as `Q[(*s,a)]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this change to the implementation, we can for example extend the world to a 3D-grid, and your code should work the same. Let's try it in World 8, where the agent has the choice of moving between two floors of the map. This is shown as diagonal up or diagonal down arrows."
