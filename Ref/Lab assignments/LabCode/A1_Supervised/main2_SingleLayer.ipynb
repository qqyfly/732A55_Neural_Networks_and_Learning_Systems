If you print `D` you will see that it contains values that are ±0.99. This might seem strange at first, where ±1 would be a more intuitive choice. However, this is a trick to prevent the weights of the network from becomming too large when using the optional *tanh* activation in the output layer. Since *tanh* never reach ±1 (only in the limit at ±Inf) it would push the weight to very large values in order to reach closer and closer to those limits. This is undesirable, so instead we choose the targets ±0.99, which only require the inputs to *tanh* to be approximately ±2.6, allowing much smaller weights and therefore a more stable classifier. None of this should matter for your implementation of the backward pass, but it is nonetheless good to understand the data you are working with."

    "The process above is a bit long, since you have to load and normalize data, initailize weights, train the network, measure metrics, and plot the results for each dataset. We can make things a bit easier by defining a function that does most of this for us. In addition to the previous parameters `epochs` and `learningRate`, this function also accepts the parameter `normalize` (True / False) which enables or disables the data normalization. You will use this to answer some questions below. You can also set the optional parameter `useTanhOutput` (True / False) to enable or diable the use of *tanh* activation in the output layer, if you have implemented it in the previous functions."
