1.1 
Supervised Learning / Unsupervised Learning / Reinforcement Learning

1.2 The feature is a characters or attributes that we may interested or will provide contribution to  the goal that we interested.

1.3a: 
x:the features we used to training the model, or is called input 
w: parameters of those inputs  
omega: target or predicated classes

1.3b:
regression is will try to generate a value , it's continuous, but classification will generate some categories, it's based on major vote sometimes.

1.3c:
We use confusion matrix or MSE or misclassification to check the performance of the model.

1.4a.
Generalize means we change to another data input and still have good performance , or the model still can be used.

1.4b: Since the test error or generalize on the real data is the target, minimize the training error to 0 looks good 
but most of the cases it will over fit the data and can not work on the new data.

1.4c: 
we need to make sure the test data not touched by the training process, which means the test data will be totally new to the model.

1.5:
accuracy rate is (80+90)/(80+90+20+30) = 170 / 220 = 0.7727

1.6:
We have 900 data, and 3 fold cross validation is as follows:
we split the data to 3 groups,1-300,301-600,601-900
1) 1-300,301-600 as training data, 601-900 as test data
    training the model, and predict, check performance
2) 1-300,601-900 as training data, 301-600 as test data
    training the model, and predict, check performance
3) 301-900 as training data, 1-300 as test data
    training the model, and predict, check performance

calc the mean of those, or some other method

1.7:
Pro: The advantage of KNN is easy to understand,only one hyper-parameter
Con: when K is big, we need huge computation time, since we need to calc the distance from 1 
point to all of them.

1.8: 
According to the plot, we find that X is very closed to the black dot,since k=1, we can get the
conclusion that X belongs to black dot class.

When k = 2, although the nearest object is the black dot, the second and third one is the square.
But black dot is closer than the square, so we know that X still belongs to black dot class.

If k = 3, According to the major vote, we know that X belongs to the square class.
